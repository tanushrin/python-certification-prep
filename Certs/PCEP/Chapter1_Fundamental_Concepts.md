# ğŸ“˜ Chapter 1: Fundamental Concepts

### 1. What is a Language?
- A **language** is a tool for expressing and recording thoughts.

### 2. Natural vs Programming Languages
- **Natural languages**: Used in daily communication (e.g., English, Hindi, German).
- **Programming languages**: Created to instruct computers (e.g., Python, C++, Java).

### 3. High-Level vs Machine Language
- **High-level**: Abstracts hardware details (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- **Machine language**: Binary instructions directly understood by CPU.

### 4. Instruction Set & Source Code
- **Instruction List (IL)**: List of basic instructions CPU understands (e.g., x86, ARM).
- **Source Code**: Human-readable code (e.g., `.py`, `.cpp`). Program written in a high-level programming language.

### 5. Compilers vs Interpreters
- **Compiler/translator**: Translates code once to binary(machine code); fast execution.
- **Interpreter**: Executes code immediately line-by-line, without translating into a machine code; slower but more flexible.
- **Python is interpreted**, usually using **CPython**.

### 6. Components of a Language
- **Alphabet**: Symbols used to construct words.
- **Lexis**: Set of valid words.
- **Syntax**: Rules for valid sequences; to build gramatically correct(not necessarily meaningful) sentences in any language.
- **Semantics**: Meaning of sequences.

> ğŸ§  Tip: Python source files end in `.py` and are interpreted by CPython.
